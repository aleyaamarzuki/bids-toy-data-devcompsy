    <h1 style="text-align:center">Grouping Task!</h1>
    <p> In this online study you will be asked to complete two phases: one
    learning phase and one testing phase. In the learning phase you will be
    shown statements describing students by a single characteristic and their
    group membership. For example, 'Daniel from Group X is brilliant'. These
    groups are completely fictitious and have no relation to any real-world
    group. After encountering multiple students from various groups, you
    will be asked to make judgement about their groups and allocate new
    students into groups.
    </p>
    <p> The purpose of this experiment is to study basic processes of learning.
    There are no foreseeable risks or discomfort associated with completing
    this study.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are free to withdraw at any time during the study, any completed
      tasks until the point of leaving will be deleted and destroyed. You are
      also free to withdraw your data at any time up until the point of
      anonymous publication of these data, which will occur at the time the
      journal article is to be published. To withdraw during the experiment,
      simply close your browser tab.
