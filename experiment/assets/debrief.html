     <h1 style="text-align:center">Thank you for taking part in the study!</h1>

     <p> This study aimed to replicate a psychological effect called
      Illusory Correlation (Hamilton and Gifford, 1976). In the illusory
      correlation person characteristics probabilistically occur with both
      majority and minority groups. This means that there was no correlation
      between characteristics and group membership. You learned about these
      relationships during the first phase, then you were transitioned to
      the test phase. In the test phase, if the rarely occurring
      characteristic is judged to be representative of the minority group and
      the frequently occurring feature to be representative of the majority
      group, then we observe the illusory correlation.

       researchers or the lecturer, Andy Wills.
       If you choose to do this, all of your data will be deleted and destroyed,
       If you are concerned about your psychological well-being after the study,
